## Rock, Paper, Scissors Generator

Hello everyone, and welcome to my page. I'll be writing a quick description on the IOS app I am creating. I don't really have a creative name for the project yet but it is basically a random generator for the popular game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" (or "Janken" in Japan). The details on the app are as follows:

- The layout is simple and minimalistic.
- You have a choice of three buttons to press: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- The generator will randomly select a response from the three options, as well.

# This project is still in the works!

## Updates
I'll be updating this page once more of the app comes together. I'm still thinking on whether or not I want some artwork involved in the app. Otherwise, nothing new at this time.
